# Food App

## This Food App was created by me as a part of my internship project at Internshala.I have used Kotlin for backend app development and Xml for frontend app development.

## Here the app retrieves its information from a web database for the list of restaurants and the menu items.

## The favorite restaurants are stored in a local Room Database.

### The features of this app are:

*A Login Page for User Login.

*A User Registration Page where the user has to register by entering details regading his address,phonenumber,email-address and password.

*A Forgot Password Page where the user can reset his password by typing his mobile number and emailaddress and then an otp will be sent to the email id which the user has used for registration for confirmation.

*A Home Page where the list of restaurants will be displayed for the user to select along with add to favorites button in the form of a heart.

*In the Home page,the restaurants can be sorted based on their price(low to High&High to Low) and based on thier rating.

*A Menu page where the list of menu items of the restaurant will be displayed.

*A Cart Page where the items ordered by the user will be displayed.
